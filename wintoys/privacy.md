> The privacy policy describes how, what and why some data might be required to be collected. By using Wintoys, you acknowledge and consent to the practices described below.

## User data

This application doesn't store, collect, use or share any personal/analytics data.

For proper operation, this application might collect your email address when sending feedback so you can receive a response back from the developer if needed.

App settings are only stored locally on your device.

Unhandled errors, exceptions or crashes are logged locally using [Event Viewer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/inside/event-viewer) and optionally in the cloud using [Azure Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview#application-insights-experiences). The option to send error reports to the developer can be configured from Settings.

## Internet connection

This app requires internet connection only for the following features:
- network statistics
- repair using DISM
- system updates
- error reporting
- feedback

You can use the app without an internet connection but the features above will not work properly.

## Other websites

Some features may contain links to other websites (such as Microsoft docs) that are not operated by the developer. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. You are strongly advised to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.
The developer has no control over and assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

## Changes

The Privacy Policy may suffer changes from time to time to reflect updates made to the app. When this Policy is changed in a material manner, you’ll be informed of such changes by updating the `Last update` label. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed of any updates. Your continued use of the Services after any modifications to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
